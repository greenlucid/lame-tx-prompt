    <p>
      frontend built to conveniently prompt arbitrary txs to a hardware wallet
      previous method i was using involved opening etherscan, pasting values manually,
      fiddling with silly wallet connection issues, sometimes requiring pasting the
      parameters again. not ideal for serious system txs, disbursing rewards, or launching
      a merkle root.
    </p>
    <p>
      other horror stories: making txs in gnosis chain involved using blockscout, which was
      hardcoded to only work with metamask, forcing me to use a different wallet,
      and using a buggy frontend that often required connecting again, sometimes forced to retry
      with 2 browsers due to a metamask bug that prevented connecting with a different wallet once a
      wallet had already connected to blockscout already, sometimes requiring reinstalling metamask entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      when blockscout refactored and somehow managed to -break- the code that allowed making txs from
      their frontend, i was forced to go to remix.ethereum.org, make a bogus contract with empty txs as interface,
      compile, used the "At address" field, figure out the format remix expects strings, bytes, hexes, arrays...
    </p>
    <h3>this is an improvement</h3>
    <p>
      use at your own risk. put in the parameters defining the tx as query parameters. if you dont know why you're here
      someone might be STEALING YOUR CRYPTO ASSETS, get away from this website, don't sign anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      how i use this: a different script creates links to this site, automatically 
      if the hardware wallet acts up, i can refresh the page and try again.
